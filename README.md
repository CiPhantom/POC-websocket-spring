# POC-websocket-spring

This is a server part of the pokerplanning project hosted on heroku. This is a simplified version used and tested by my team with Capgemini. :bowtie:

I'm kindly proud of this little work. :heart: 

## Specifications 

This project is based on stomp protocal by Spring.
Stomp protocol allows us to create reactive applications based on events. It gives you abilities to receive event and reuse them for broadcasting of other data processing.

### You may find other samples on this project like : 

* how to manage the interceptor
* how to manage lifecycle of subscribed user on a topic
* \+ Just for experimentation there is a useless Avro implementation as a maven plugin. Sorry for that :laughing:
